## Summary
We explored the mathematical structure of multilinear regression using core concepts from linear algebra. The paper derives and explains the normal equations, conditions for invertibility, and the implications of the Gauss-Markov theorem. It also includes applied examples in sports analytics and energy forecasting to demonstrate practical value.
